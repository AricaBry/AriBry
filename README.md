# Hello! I'm Arica! 

:star: My journey into programming began during high school when I enrolled in a web design course. There, I delved into the fundamentals of HTML and created my first small website. I improved on my programming skills when I transitioned into college. 

:books: Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.

:computer: Throughout my academic journey, I've gained skills in several programming languages including Python, Java, and C++. I've also delved a bit into computer graphics and 3D modeling. With school and current life challenges I rarely have free time but when I do I enjoy completing code challenges, working through Udemy courses, and tinkering with personal projects.

:wrench: I am currently working to develop a simple Food Tracking app in Android Studio.
